# Courier-Database-Management
 This is a Mini Project built using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL 
 I have used a Xampp Server as a Local Server for Building this Project 
 This is just a Mini Project so I have Not made it much Detailed and 
 Havn't included the Billing Feature Apart from that 
 import the SQL file in your localhost so that it can run properly
 We Basically can perform CRUD operations in this 
 Just copy download this and Paste it in your Xampp/htdocs folder and 
 Open it through the localhost Then you are Good to go!
